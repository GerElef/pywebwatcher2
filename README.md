Alpha. Unexpected behaviour will definitely occur, updates are irregular, and features are amiss.

## TODO:
- Add config file + flag [Progress will start later on.]
- Add a visualizer for the sniffer. [Progress will start later on.]
- Create fast custom C engine for "compiling" PDF files, with a python3 API, to use in this project. [Progress will start 2021 Summer] [Highest priority]
- Add an actual UI to start the program so CMD isn't required to always be up. [POSTPONED]
